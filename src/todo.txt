clients "subscribe" to and "unsubscribe" from locationIDs
    server has
    subscribed_clients{
        HashMap<LocationID,HashSet<ClientID>>,
    }

    whenever the server make a change somewhere, the server generates a broadcast message.
        this broadcast is enqueued immediately, and sent later.

        some other bookkeeping data is stored:
            last_simulated : HashMap<LocationID,Instant>
            last_backgrounded : HashMap<LocationID,Instant>

    when a client subscribes to location NOT foreground-loaded, the server foreground loads it.
        the server checks (last_simulated) and quickly predicts X foreground time ticks.

    periodically, the server will iterate over background locations and check (last_backgrounded)
        if they have been backgrounded long enough, they are unloaded.

clients on boot subscribed nowhere, and send a special HelloWorld message
    server ensures:
        client is subscribed to at least 1 location
        client controls 1 object
    (if this is not the case, the server spawns the client, satisfying those reqs)
